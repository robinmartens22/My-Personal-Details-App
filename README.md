# My-Personal-Details-App
I made this app to learn how to code with flutter, i used the app brewery flutter course for it. I have no intention to make this app available for the public and is for my study purpose only.

The app is made to show my contact details, it has one screen. When you click on my info you will be able to call or email me directly from your phone.

If i would have a future use for it, i would make it so everybody can use it as a personal details app where you can easiliy put your contact details in with the help of a dashboard.
